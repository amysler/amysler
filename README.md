## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
### Let me introduce myself: My name is Alan Mysler and IÂ´m 31 years old. I finished my career as a physician with clinical & oncology related formation but got dazzled by the amazing world of data and IT. That's when I decided to change the flow of the classic healthcare professional. Initiated my way to become a data scientist by completing HenryÂ´s bootcamp, and Iâ€™m certain that this is just the beginning of the journey into this amazing field.
